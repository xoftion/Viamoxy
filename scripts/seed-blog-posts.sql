  '5 Proven Strategies to Boost Your Instagram Engagement in 2024',
  'instagram-engagement-strategies-2024',
  '<p>Instagram continues to be one of the most powerful platforms for brand visibility and engagement. Here are five proven strategies to boost your engagement:</p>
  
  <h2>1. Leverage Reels and Short-Form Video</h2>
  <p>Instagram''s algorithm heavily favors Reels. Creating short, engaging video content can significantly increase your reach and visibility. Aim for 15-30 second videos that capture attention immediately.</p>
  
  <h2>2. Optimize Your Posting Schedule</h2>
  <p>Post when your audience is most active. Use Instagram Insights to determine the best times for your specific audience. Generally, posting between 11 AM - 1 PM and 7 PM - 9 PM works well for most niches.</p>
  
  <h2>3. Use Strategic Hashtags</h2>
  <p>Mix popular hashtags with niche-specific ones. Use 20-30 hashtags per post, combining high-volume tags (1M+ posts) with medium (100K-1M) and low-volume tags (under 100K) for optimal reach.</p>
  
  <h2>4. Engage Authentically</h2>
  <p>Respond to comments within the first hour of posting. Engage with your followers'' content. This signals to Instagram that you''re an active, valuable community member.</p>
